# T5 Fine-Tuning and Enhanced Architectures for e-SNLI

This repository explores various approaches to leveraging T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) for solving the e-SNLI (explainable SNLI) problem. The approaches include fine-tuning the T5 model on the e-SNLI dataset, integrating T5 with graph-based methods (GNN), and enhancing T5 using dependency and constituency parsing techniques.
